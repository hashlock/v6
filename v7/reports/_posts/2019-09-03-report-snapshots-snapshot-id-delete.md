{.inline-code}Deletes the specified report snapshot in ThousandEyes, based on the snapshotId provided in the API request. Users with the `Edit reports for all users in account group` permission (Account Admin) can delete any report snapshot. Users with `Edit own reports` permission (Regular User) can only delete the report snapshots for reports they have created.

### Parameters

* `aid={aid}` optional and requires the user to be assigned to the target account group, specifies the account group context of the request, obtained from the `/account-groups` endpoint.  Specifying this parameter without the user being assigned to the target account will result in an error response. See [Account group context][overview-accountcontext] for more information
* `{snapshotId}` the ID of the report snapshot you would like to delete

### Response

If the report snapshot is successfully deleted, an HTTP 204 NO CONTENT response will be returned. If user lacks the permissions to delete the report, an HTTP 401 UNAUTHORIZED response will be returned.

Response has no body.
