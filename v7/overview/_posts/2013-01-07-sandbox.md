For many people, working with an API requires that you look at some sample data -- at least, that's how we learn, so we want to extend you the same courtesy.

If you want to play around with the API and understand the data in the system, use the API Sandbox account.  

We've made available an account which can be used to access the ThousandEyes API, and all documentation references made in the ThousandEyes developer reference are based on content extracted from the Sandbox account, to allow you contextual cues and information.

The following username and authToken can be used to authenticate with our API.

* Username: `noreply@thousandeyes.com`
* AuthToken: `g351mw5xqhvkmh1vq6zfm51c62wyzib2`

Users don't have permissions to make changes to settings and/or tests in the account, but can leverage this account for working with the methods provided by the API, and understanding the data.
