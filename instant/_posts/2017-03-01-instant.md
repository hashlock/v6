### Optional (Querystring) Parameters

* `aid={aid}` optional and requires the user to be assigned to the target account group, specifies the account group context of the request, obtained from the `/account-groups` endpoint.  Specifying this parameter without the user being assigned to the target account will result in an error response. See [Account group context][overview-accountcontext] for more information

  * agent-to-agent

  *Note: bgp tests are currently not supported*

The following fields are accepted but will be ignored by the Instant test API:
  * interval

### Response

If an instant test is successfully created and ran, an HTTP/201 CREATED response will be returned, and the test definition will be returned. See the example below.

Response does not include instant test results. Once the instant test is created and ran, results can be retrieved using [Test Data][test-data] endpoints. API test data endpoints URLs are provided in test definition output upon instant test creation. See the example below.

### Example

Please note, Instant tests are not allowed on the Sandbox API account, and will not work if attempted.  The following example is presented for documentation and reference purposes only.

`$ curl -i https://api.thousandeyes.com{{ site.version_url_prefix_request }}/instant/agent-to-server \
  -d '{ "agents": [ {"agentId": 113} ], "testName": "API Instant test", "server": "www.thousandeyes.com" }' \

  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -u noreply@thousandeyes.com:g351mw5xqhvkmh1vq6zfm51c62wyzib2`
