Returns details for an agent, including assigned tests.  Enterprise agents show utilization data and assigned accounts.

### Optional (Querystring) Parameters

* `format=json|xml` optional, specifies the format of output requested.  See [Output Formats][overview-outputformats] for more information
* `aid={aid}` optional and requires the user to be assigned to the target account group, specifies the account group context of the request, obtained from the `/account-groups` endpoint.  Specifying this parameter without the user being assigned to the target account will result in an error response. See [Account group context][overview-accountcontext] for more information

### Request

* no request body

### Example

`$ curl https://api.thousandeyes.com{{ site.version_url_prefix_request }}/agents/12.json \
  -u noreply@thousandeyes.com:g351mw5xqhvkmh1vq6zfm51c62wyzib2`
