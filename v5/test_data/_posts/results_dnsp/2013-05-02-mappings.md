Returns the mapping, and percentage (as measured by the number of vantage points globally which respond with that mapping) for a domain, aggregated on a country basis.  Where multiple mappings are detected in a country, each mapping will be shown, along with a corresponding number of vantage points responding with that mapping.

### Optional Parameters

* `format=json|xml` (Optional) specifies the format of output requested.  See [Output Formats][overview-outputformats] for more information
* `window=[0-9]+[smhdw]?` (Optional) specifies a window of time for the result set.  See [Time Ranges][overview-timerange] for more information.
* `from=YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS&to=YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS` (Optional) specifies an explicit start (and optionally, end) for your range of data.  See [Time Ranges][overview-timerange] for more information.
* `aid={accountId}` optional and requires the user to be assigned to the target account, specifies the account context of the request, obtained from the `/accounts` endpoint.  Specifying this parameter without the user to be assigned to the target account will result in an error response. See [Account Context][overview-accountcontext] for more information

### Request

* `{testId}` (Required) the ID of the DNS+ Domain test you for wish to retrieve data
* `{testId}/{countryId}` (Optional) append `{countryId}` to return results only for that Country.  Wildcard `\*` is supported, to return a single global aggregate.
* `{testId}/{countryId}/network` (Optional) append `network` to obtain network-level data for a specific country.  Wildcard `\*` is not supported.

### Response

For country-agnostic DNS+ measurements, aggregate values will be returned for each country with vantage points tested in the verification.  Data is grouped on a country basis; the first record returned is a \* record, which indicates rollup values for all countries in which vantage points were present.

To return aggregate data for a single country, append the two-digit (ISO-3166-1 alpha-2) country code to the request:

`$curl https://api.thousandeyes.com{{ site.version_url_prefix_request }}/dnsp/mappings/{testId}/{countryId}.json \
  -u noreply@thousandeyes.com:g351mw5xqhvkmh1vq6zfm51c62wyzib2`
  
To return data aggregated at the network (autonomous system) level, append /network to the single-country request (as follows), and a list of networks will be shown, with aggregated information at the network level:

`$curl https://api.thousandeyes.com{{ site.version_url_prefix_request }}/dnsp/mappings/{testId}/{countryId}/network.json \
  -u noreply@thousandeyes.com:g351mw5xqhvkmh1vq6zfm51c62wyzib2`
