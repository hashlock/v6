Returns a sequenced list of networks transited for a specific network prefix.  Shows a list of monitors assigned to the test, and the paths transited to reach the destination.  This is analogous to showing the ASPath information from a BGP Routing Information Base (rib) dump.  

Note: this endpoint is only available in versions 5 of the ThousandEyes API (or higher)
, and must be called explicitly with that version number at this time.  

### Optional Parameters

* `format=json|xml` optional, specifies the format of output requested.  See [Output Formats][overview-outputformats] for more information
* `aid={accountId}` optional and requires the user to be assigned to the target account, specifies the account context of the request, obtained from the `/accounts` endpoint.  Specifying this parameter without the user to be assigned to the target account will result in an error response. See [Account Context][overview-accountcontext] for more information

### Request

* `{testId}` the ID of the test for which BGP data is of interest
* `{prefixId}` the ID of the prefix in question. Obtain prefixId from the `/net/bgp-metrics/{testId}` endpoint
* `{roundId}` the round for which you wish to obtain data.  Obtain roundId from the `/net/bgp-metrics/{testId}` endpoint 

### Response

* **Note:** Monitors are not agents.  Not all agents are in a network being monitored, and not all monitors have associated agents.

Field | Data Type | Units | Notes
:------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
monitorId | integer | n/a | unique ID of monitor, from `/bgp-monitors` endpoint
monitorName | string | n/a | display name used for the monitor
countryId | string | n/a | ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the agent
date | dateTime | n/a | yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss, in UTC
roundId | long | seconds | epoch time (seconds) indicating the start time of the round
permalink | url | n/a | link to jump to this result in the front end
prefixId | integer | n/a | internally tracked prefix ID
prefix | string | n/a | prefix being tracked
active | boolean | n/a | 1 for an active route, 0 for an inactive route. An inactive route was an active route in the previous test round and is now superseded by another active (preferred) route. When requesting data for the test round in which a route change happened, both routes (active and inactive one) are included in the response.
hops | array | n/a | see below for individual hop fields
hops.asn | integer | n/a | ASN of transit autonomous system
hops.asName | string | n/a | name of autonomous system
